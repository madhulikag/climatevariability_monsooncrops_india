Influence of natural climate variability modes such as ENSO and IOD on five summer monsoon crops (Rice, Maize, Sorghum, Pearl Millet, and Finger Millet) in India

1. Fig1.R #Trends in yield, production, harvested area, weighted yields, and irrigated area for the five summer monsoon crops
2. Fig2.R #El Niño and Positive IOD decreases national-average crop yields
3. Fig3&S2.R #Simultaneous declines in multiple crops and grains likely to reduce during El Niño and positive IOD events
4. FigS8.R #Scatterplots of grain characteristics anomalies to ENSO and IOD 
5. Fig6&S9.R #Different sensitivity of crops to ENSO and IOD & #Yield Anomalies across 5 cereals for Irrigated and Rainfed districts during ENSO and IOD
6. Fig1&S1.R #District maps of average crop yields from 1966-2017 & #District maps of proportion of irrigated to harvested areas for each monsoon crop averaged from 1966-2017.
