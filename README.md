# climatevariability_monsooncrops_india
Influence of natural climate variability modes such as ENSO and IOD on five summer monsoon crops (Rice, Maize, Sorghum, Pearl Millet, and Finger Millet) in India

1. Fig1.R # Varying trends in production and harvested area of Rice, Maize and traditional grains despite increases in yields
2. Fig2.R # El Niño decreases national-average crop yields
3. Fig3&S2-3.R # Simultaneous declines in multiple crops and grains likely to reduce during El Niño and positive IOD events
4. FigS10.R # Scatterplots of grain characteristics anomalies to ENSO and IOD
5. Fig6.R # Comparison of the sensitivity of alternative grains to climate variability relative to rice
6. FigS4.R Yield Anomalies across 5 cereals for Irrigated and Rainfed districts during ENSO and IOD
