# climatevariability_monsooncrops_india
Influence of natural climate variability modes such as ENSO and IOD on five summer monsoon crops (Rice, Maize, Sorghum, Pearl Millet, and Finger Millet) in India

1. Fig1.R # Varying trends in production and harvested area of Rice, Maize and traditional grains despite increases in yields
2. Fig2.R # El Ni単o decreases national-average crop yields
3. Fig3&S2-3.R # Simultaneous declines in multiple crops and grains likely to reduce during El Ni単o and positive IOD events
4. FigS10.R # Scatterplots of grain characteristics anomalies to ENSO and IOD
5. Fig6&S4&S11.R # Comparison of the sensitivity of alternative grains to climate variability relative to rice # Metric Anomalies across 5 cereals for Irrigated and Rainfed districts during ENSO and IOD
6. Fig1&6&S1&11.R # District maps of proportion of irrigated to harvested areas for each monsoon crop averaged from 1966-2017 # District maps of average crop yields from 1966-2017 # Comparison of the sensitivity of alternative grains to climate variability relative to rice (inset maps)
