Influence of natural climate variability modes such as ENSO and IOD on five summer monsoon crops (Rice, Maize, Sorghum, Pearl Millet, and Finger Millet) in India

1. Fig1.R # Varying trends in production and harvested area of Rice, Maize and traditional grains despite increases in yields
2. Fig2.R # El Niño decreases national-average crop yields
3. Fig3&S2-3.R # Simultaneous declines in multiple crops and grains likely to reduce during El Niño and positive IOD events
4. FigS10.R #Scatterplots of grain characteristics anomalies to ENSO and IOD
5. Fig6&S9.R #Different sensitivity of crops to ENSO and IOD & #Yield Anomalies across 5 cereals for Irrigated and Rainfed districts during ENSO and IOD
7. Fig1&S1.R #District maps of average crop yields from 1966-2017 & #District maps of proportion of irrigated to harvested areas for each monsoon crop averaged from 1966-2017.
